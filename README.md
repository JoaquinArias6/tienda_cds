# README

For the project to work as intended, it is necessary the load of the fixtures, used as some kind of test
and for better views when first running the server.

For this purpose, it is simply required to write "bin/rails db:fixtures:load" in the terminal, specifically 
within the "tienda_cds" folder.

After doing that, the running of the server should not generate any problem.

Some aclarations (about thing that must be solved):
	- The image input required to add a product, awaits for an url, with a jpg or png 
	extension
	- The rendering of the images in the main page, as well as in the favorite page,
	it's not quite "good-looking", and seems to be inconsistent between each other. 

If there is any issues, please, send me an email to: joaquin61200@hotmail.com
